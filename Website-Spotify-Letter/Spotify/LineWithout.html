    <div class="lyrics-box">
        Oh, baby, I am a wreck when I'm without you<br>
        I need you here to stay<br>
        I broke all my bones that day I found you<br>
        Crying at the lake<br>
        Was it something I said to make you feel like you're a burden?<br>
        Oh, and if I could take it all back<br>
        I swear that I would pull you from the tide

      <p class="desc">Kalaupun kita berantem hebat, I wish mas tetep stay. Even I push u hard, I just want u to stay. Even it hurts u, even u tired of me, even ur heart didnt beat as harder as at the first time we meet. I just want u to stay. Egois ya?? Tapi emang gini jeleknya aku mas. Mungkin secara ga sadar aku nyakitin mas, but please communicate it with me either u find someone else or just letting me go. I'll take a notes and didn't made same mistake. Trust me, I'm trying to be better person for u, mas. It's all bcz I want u to stay... </p>
