        Oh, won't you kiss me on the mouth and love me like a sailor?<br>
        When you get a taste, can you tell me what's my flavor?<br>
        I do<s>n't</s> believe in God, but I believe that you're my savior<br>
        I know that you've been worried, but you're dripping in my favor<br>
        And when we're getting dirty, I forget all that is wrong<br>
        I sleep so I can see you 'cause I hate to wait so long<br>
        I sleep so that I can see you and I hate to wait so long

      <p class="desc">Won't you kiss me on the mouth? Won't u hug me thigh? Won't u... akh, nevermind. Even I know we're getting dirty, I'll forget that all is wrong. But be honest, if I stopped being dirty would u still stay? Won't u leave me?</p>
