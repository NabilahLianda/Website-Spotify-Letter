    <div class="lyrics-box">
      Feel like a brand-new person<br>
      But you'll make the same old mistakes<br>
      Well, I don't care, I'm in love<br>
      Stop before it's too late<br>
      Feel like a brand-new person<br>
      But you'll make the same old mistakes<br>
      So how do I know I've gone too far? (You don't have what it takes)<br><br>
      Stop before it's too late<br>
      Man, I know that it's hard to digest<br>
      But maybe your story ain't so different from the rest<br>
      And I know it seems wrong to accept<br>
      But you've got your demons, and she's got her regrets<br>
      Man, I know that it's hard to digest<br>
      A realization is as good as a guess
